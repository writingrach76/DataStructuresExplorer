I took a data structures class, and we didn't write a single data structure ourselves so here we are, trying to understand data structures and algorithms on our own because I'm bitter.

This is a recreation of some of the major data structures in computer science, and possibly later some of the algorithms used to search and sort them as well.

Current implementation of:
Single and Doubley linked lists
